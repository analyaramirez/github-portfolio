			</header>

				<h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
				<h4>Organizations face the ongoing problem of successfully managing and compensating their 
					employees in today's dynamic and continually evolving workforce. Employee remuneration 
					affects not only a person's financial stability, but also their job satisfaction, motivation, and overall 
					performance. However, effectively categorizing employee pay as high, medium, or low is a 
					difficult undertaking that necessitates a thorough grasp of the different elements that influence 
					compensation decisions. As a result, organizations frequently struggle to maintain a fair and 
					transparent remuneration system that is aligned with employee contributions. 
					The significance of resolving this issue cannot be emphasized. Employee engagement, retention, 
					and productivity are all dependent on a fair and balanced compensation scheme. When 
					employees believe their compensation are consistent with their talents, expertise, and efforts, it 
					generates a sense of justice and motivates them to achieve to their full potential. An unfair or 
					misaligned remuneration structure, on the other hand, can lead to demotivation, decreased job 
					satisfaction, and increased turnover rates, hurting organizational performance. 
					To solve this essential issue, this research proposes developing predictive models capable of 
					accurately categorizing employee pay based on a wide range of independent parameters. We hope 
					to capture the multifaceted nature of salary categorization by utilizing a variety of variables such 
					as the individual's level of happiness, average monthly working hours, tenure within the 
					organization, current employment status, past promotions within the last five years, and 
					department affiliation (particularly the sales department). 
					This study will use four distinct types of predictive models—logistic regression, random forests, decision 
					trees, and naive Bayes—to see which strategy is most effective for properly forecasting employee 
					compensation categories. We will choose the best-performing model based on scoring measures like as 
					accuracy, precision, F1 score, and recall score. 
					The data set chosen for this project is the "HR_comma_sep", 
					<a ><li  style="list-style: none;" href="(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/liujiaqi/hr-comma-sepcsv) from Kaggle. This data set contains 14998 ">(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/liujiaqi/hr-comma-sepcsv) from Kaggle. This data set contains 14998 </li></a>
					records of employees and 10 variables/features. .</h4>

				<h2><strong>Analysis and Insights EDA </strong></h2>
				<h4>To analyze the dataset, EDA employs a number of approaches and tools, such as summary statistics, 
					data visualization, and data cleaning. </h4>
				<br>
				<h2><strong>a) Descriptive statistics </strong></h2>
				<img src="./images/fulls/predictiveReport.PNG" alt="">
<br>
<h4>The table above provides the summary of descriptive statistics which includes the mean, standard deviation, 
	minimum and maximum of all the variables. </h4>

				<h2><strong>b)
					Distribution of Department
					</strong></h2>
					<img src="./images/fulls/analysis.PNG" alt="">
				<br>
				<h4>The distribution shows that the sales department has the highest distribution of employees while 
					management department has the least number of employees. </h4>
				<br>
				<h2><strong>c)
					Distribution of sales Category </strong></h2>
					<img src="./images/fulls/analysis2.PNG" alt="">
				<br>
			
				<h4> The distribution shows that the number of employees who receive low salary is higher followed by 
					medium category while high salaried employees are the least. 
				</h4>
				<br>
				<h2><strong> d)
					Distribution of satisfaction level </strong></h2>
					<img src="./images/fulls/analysis3.PNG" alt="">
				<br>
				<h4> The distribution of satisfaction level is not normally distributed i.e. its not symmetric.  </h4>
				<br>

				<h2><strong> Data Preparation  </strong></h2>
				<h4> The data preparation phase is a crucial step in research, ensuring that the dataset is cleaned, transformed, 
					and organized for further analysis and modeling. The data preparation techniques 
					performed on this data include Feature Scaling, One-Hot Encoding, Binning, Log Transformation 
					and Feature Interaction.
				</h4>
				<br>

				<h2><strong> e)
					Model Building </strong></h2>
				<h4> The model development phase is an important element in this research since it involves 
					developing prediction models to appropriately categorize employee compensation as high, 
					medium, or low based on a range of independent characteristics. During this step, relevant 
					modelling approaches are chosen, models are trained on the prepared dataset, their performance 
					is evaluated, and the best-performing model is chosen for further research. For this research, 4 
					types of models are used to predict salary i.e. logistics regression, random forests, decision trees 
					and naive Bayes and use scoring metrics that includes accuracy, precision, F1 score and recall 
					score to determine the best model for predicting employee’s salary. 
				</h4>
				<img src="./images/fulls/analysis4.PNG" alt="">
				<br>
				<h4> From the model development and evaluation, the following conclusions can be drawn: 
					<br>
					1. Logistic Regression: The accuracy of the logistic regression model was approximately 
					<br>
					49.6%. Additionally, the precision, recall, and F1 score were relatively low. 
					<br>
					2. Random Forest: The random forest model outperformed logistic regression by 
					approximately 62.5% in terms of accuracy. As indicated by the confusion matrix, its 
					performance improved across all salary brackets. In comparison to logistic regression, the 
					precision, recall, and F1 score were notably higher. 
					<br>
					3. Decision Trees: The accuracy of the decision tree model was approximately 59.6%. The 
					performance was comparable to that of random forest, albeit with slightly inferior 
					<br>
					precision, recall, and F1 score values. However, it was still superior to logistic regression. 
					4. The accuracy of the naive Bayes model was approximately 49.2 percent. Additionally, the 
					precision, recall, and F1 score were relatively low. 
					<br>
					Overall, among the evaluated models, the random forest model demonstrated the highest levels 
					of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Compared to other models, it demonstrated a 
					superior ability to predict differences in salary categories.
				</h4>
				<br>
				<h2><strong> Conclusion </strong></h2>
				<h4> Based on the results of the model development and evaluation, several conclusions can be drawn. 
					The random forest model emerged as the most promising among the evaluated models. It 
					showcased the highest levels of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, indicating its superior 
					ability to predict salary categories. Therefore, it could be considered for deployment in practical 
					applications. 
					<br>
					However, before deploying the model, several considerations and challenges need to be explored. 
					First, it is important to assess the generalizability of the model on unseen data to ensure its 
					robustness. Additionally, further analysis should be conducted to understand the factors that 
					contribute most to the model's predictions, as this can provide valuable insights and enhance 
					interpretability. 
					<br>
					Moreover, the performance of the model should be evaluated on diverse datasets to account for 
					potential biases and ensure fair predictions across different demographic groups. It is crucial to 
					address any biases present in the data or the model itself to avoid perpetuating discriminatory 
					outcomes. Furthermore, ongoing monitoring and re-evaluation of the deployed model's 
					performance is essential to detect any degradation in accuracy or biases that may arise due to 
					evolving data patterns or changes in the target population. 
					<br>
					In conclusion, while the random forest model demonstrates promising performance, additional 
					exploration and validation are necessary before deploying it in real-world applications. 
					Addressing potential challenges such as generalizability, interpretability, bias mitigation, and 
					ongoing monitoring will contribute to the model's readiness and reliability.
